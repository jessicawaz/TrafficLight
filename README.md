# TrafficLight

Traffic light simulator written in Assembly. Built using an Arduino Uno R3 and Atmel Studio. This was done for a final project in Computer Organization and Assmebly Language Programming in my 2020 fall semester at Florida Gulf Coast University. It was an individual project created with a little help from Professor Paul Allen. There are three LED lights for the traffic signal: red, yellow, and green. There is one LED light for the crosswalk signal: white. A pedestrian button is included that can be pressed to turn the crosswalk light on. Each light turns on for a specified period of time. Green is 6 seconds, yellow is two seconds, red is four seconds, and white is two seconds.
